# Journey with Python üêç
This repo consists of all the Resources that I followed during my Journey with Python. **But who am I?** I am a Novice Learner, in the world of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.  
The **resources** include links of Courses, Youtube Videos & Playlists that I followed, Interview Talks & Live Talks that motivated me, Research Papers that I read for a better perspective of how things work, my Repositories (Course Repos/Case Studies/Projects) and much more.
